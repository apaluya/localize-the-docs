# Localize the Docs



# G11n I18n L10n T9n... WTF?!

## GILT

The term _localization_ is often used as shorthand for the following domains:

- Globalization _(G11n)_
- Internationalization _(I18n)_
- Localization _(L10n)_
- Translation _(T9n)_

## Globalization Concerns

- _"Can we profit by entering a specific language/locale market?"_
- _"What is the current i18n and l10n state of the product?"_
- _"What is the estimated time to market?"_
- _"What is the expected ROI?"_
- _"What resources must we deploy to achieve our goals?"_

## Internationalization Concerns

- _"Is code structured to support localized resources?"_
- _"Are string resources isolated and easy to update?"_
- _"Can the UI handle localized presentations?"_
- _"How efficiently can we deploy localized resources?"_
- _"Is refactoring necessary? If so, how much?"_
- _"If we choose not to refactor, what will the remaining inefficiencies cost us?"_
- _"Are localized components testable?"_

## Localization Concerns

- _"Are we partnered with a competent, capable LSP?"_
- _"How efficiently can we round-trip content?"_
- _"Have we identified our domain-specific terminologies?"_

## Translation Concerns

- _"What languages/locales should we support?"_
- _"Does the LSP have access to enough competent translators and reviewers for each language/locale pairing?"_

## GILT Assessment

The decision to localize should be guided by a _GILT assessment_, which examines the following:

- The business case _(globalization)_
- Product infrastructure _(internationalization)_
- Process infrastructure _(localization)_
- Competency of service providers _(translation)_


## Localization Maturity Model

The _localization maturity model_ can be used to gauge an organization's overall localization capabilities. The model includes the following degrees:

- `0` **Negligent**
- `1` **Reactive**
- `2` **Repeatable**
- `3` **Managed**
- `4` **Optimized**
- `5` **Transparent**

## Localization Maturity Model

`0` **Negligent**

No thought or effort expended on GILT

## Localization Maturity Model

`1` **Reactive**

Ad hoc, lack of defined process, lots of surprises

## Localization Maturity Model

`2` **Repeatable**

There are processes, but they're manual, time-consuming, error-prone

## Localization Maturity Model

`3` **Managed**

Automated processes, efficient turnarounds

## Localization Maturity Model

`4` **Optimized**

Data-based (metrics), specialized tools and systems (TMS/CCMS), distributed environments; deep insight into project state

## Localization Maturity Model

`5` **Transparent**

GILT nirvana, pervading the entire system from business to operations, from beginning to end
