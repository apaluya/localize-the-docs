## Localization Maturity Model

- `0` **Negligent**
- `1` **Reactive**
- `2` **Repeatable**
- `3` **Managed**
- `4` **Optimized**
- `5` **Transparent**

## Localization Maturity Model

**Negligent**

No thought or effort expended on GILT

## Localization Maturity Model

**Reactive**

Ad hoc, lack of defined process, lots of surprises

## Localization Maturity Model

**Repeatable**

Manual processes, time-consuming, error-prone

## Localization Maturity Model

**Managed**

Automated processes, efficient turnarounds

## Localization Maturity Model

**Optimized**

Data-based (metrics), specialized tools and systems (TMS/CCMS), distributed environments; deep insight into project state

## Localization Maturity Model

**Transparent**

True GILT, pervading the entire system from business to operations, from beginning to end


## GILT Assessment

The decision to localize isn't merely a question of languages. It entails an assessment that begins from a globalization perspective (the broadest, highest level) and proceeds through internationalization (product infrastructure) and localization (process infrastructure) and only then to translation.

## G11n Concerns

- _"Should we deploy our product in a specific language/locale market?"_
- _"What will it take for us to do so?"_

## I18n Concerns

- _"How is the product structured internally? Are string resources in explicit locations, and are they easy to update?"_
- _"Does the product have hooks for supporting localized resources?"_
- _"How efficiently can we deploy localized resources?"_
- _"Is refactoring necessary? If so, how much?"_
- _"If we choose not to refactor, what will the remaining inefficiencies cost us?"_
- _"Are localized components testable?"_

## L10n Concerns

- _"Are we partnered with a competent LSP that has the appropriate capabilities?"_
- _"How efficiently can we round-trip content?"_
- _"Do we have existing translation memory that we can leverage?"_
- _"Have we identified our domain-specific terminologies?"_

## T9n Concerns

- _"What languages/locales should we support?"_
- _"Does the LSP have access to enough competent translators and reviewers for that language/locale pairing?"_
