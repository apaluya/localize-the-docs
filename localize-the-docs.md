# G11n I18n L10n T9n... WTF?!

## GILT

The term _localization_ is often used as shorthand for the following domains:

- Globalization _(G11n)_
- Internationalization _(I18n)_
- Localization _(L10n)_
- Translation _(T9n)_

## GILT Assessment

The decision to localize should be guided by a _GILT assessment_, which examines the following:

- The business case _(globalization)_
- Product infrastructure _(internationalization)_
- Process infrastructure _(localization)_
- Competency of service providers _(translation)_

## Globalization Concerns

- _"Can we profit by entering a specific language/locale market?"_
- _"What is the current i18n and l10n state of the product?"_
- _"What is the estimated time to market?"_
- _"What is the expected ROI?"_
- _"What resources must we deploy to achieve our goals?"_

## Internationalization Concerns

- _"Is code structured to support localized resources?"_
- _"Can the UI handle localized presentations?"_
- _"How efficiently can we deploy localized resources?"_
- _"Is refactoring necessary? If so, how much?"_
- _"Are localized components testable?"_

## Localization Concerns

- _"Are we partnered with a competent, capable LSP?"_
- _"How efficiently can we round-trip content?"_
- _"Have we identified our domain-specific terminologies?"_
- _"Is doc content written in global English?"_
- _"Are images localizable?"_

## Translation Concerns

- _"What languages/locales should we support?"_
- _"Does the LSP have access to enough competent translators and reviewers for each language/locale pairing?"_


## GILT Assessment

A GILT assessment can identify the following:

- Possible bottlenecks
- Hidden internal costs
- Potential ROI
- Feasibility

## Localization Service Providers

A localization service provider (LSP) can offer the following:

- Experienced professionals
- Industry knowledge and guidance
- Modern tool systems
- Vetted translators and reviewers
- Project management
- Reporting capabilities
- _Remember, you get what you pay for!_

## Costs: Basic Per-word Estimates

| Lang group        | Word price  |
|-------------------|-------------|
| Chinese Simpl.    | $0.13~0.17  |
| Western Euro      | $0.15~0.19  |
| Centrl/East. Euro | $0.18~0.22  |
| Korean            | $0.18~0.22  |
| Middle East       | $0.21~0.25  |
| Japan             | $0.24~0.28  |

_General estimates for technical t9n, YMMV_

## Costs: Reuse

| Match type         | Cost % |
|--------------------|--------|
| New word           |  100%  |
| Leveraged match    |   30%  |
| Repeat             |   30%  |
| 95~99% fuzzy match |   40%  |
| 85~95% fuzzy match |   65%  |
| 75~85% fuzzy match |   75%  |
| Non-translatable   |   10%  |

## Costs: Project Fees

| Service            | Pricing   |
|--------------------|-----------|
| Project management |    5~10%  |
| Desktop publishing | $55~75/hr |
| Engineering        | $55~75/hr |
| Rush job           |   20~25%  |

_General estimates for technical t9n, YMMV_


## Localization Maturity Model

The _localization maturity model_ can be used to gauge an organization's overall localization capacities. The model includes the following stages:

- `0` **Negligent**: Wait, we're localizing?!
- `1` **Reactive**: Ad hoc, lots of surprises
- `2` **Repeatable**: Manual processes, inefficient
- `3` **Managed**: Automated processes, efficient
- `4` **Optimized**: Data-driven, specialized systems
- `5` **Transparent**: GILT nirvana

## Takeaways

- Do a GILT assessment
- Partner up with a good, reputable LSP
- Expect to pay market rates for professional-level service
